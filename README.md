# Quotes API

## What's this?

A very simple API for fetching quotes related to programming.

## Where can I see it in action?

Go to https://simple-quotes-api.herokuapp.com for a list of quotes or https://simple-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/random to get a random quote.

## Why?

The purpose of the API is to make it a bit easier to complete the freeCodeCamp [Quote Generator project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).
In the process, I want to give CodeNewbies the opportunity to contribute and practice working with git and github.

## How can I contribute?

Take a look at the open issues. If you see something you would like to try, fork the project, make a commit and open a pull request.

To format your code, use `npm run fix-format` - this will run prettier and apply a standardised code style.

To run the automated test, use `npm test` - you'll get a report on what tests are passing and failing. 

If you're unsure or struggling, don't be afraid to reach out.

## Running this locally

To run the API locally, clone the repo and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
